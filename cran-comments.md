## Resubmission  
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:  

* Fixed "<ERROR: re-encoding failure from encoding 'UTF-8'>" in 
`general_clean_directory` and `trades_clean_directory` following the removal of
the package from CRAN.  
* Added extra functionalities in the form of two extra parameters for the 
`combine_match_general_to_trades`.  


## Resubmission  
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:  

* Spelled out all acronyms in the description text.  
* Add \value to .Rd files for all exported methods and explained the functions 
results more thoroughly in the documentation.  
* Removed examples for unexported functions.  
* Used suppressWarnings() in place of options(warn=-1) where needed. 


## R CMD check results  
0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note
