## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:  

* Spelled out all acronyms in the description text.  
* Add \value to .Rd files for all exported methods and explained the functions results more thoroughly in the documentation.  
* Removed examples for unexported functions.  
* Used suppressWarnings() in place of options(warn=-1) where needed. 


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
